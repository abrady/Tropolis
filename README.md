# Tropolis

This is a simple prototype demonstrating the Overlord sprite.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server. Node.js 20 or newer is
required by Vite 7, so make sure your environment is up to date:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server will automatically open the game in your browser and reload on changes.
